## Roadmap

- Step 1 : Head to index.py it's a basic flask app which need to run on the port 3000 (or you can create a flask app of your own haed to Reference 1.01 in Documentation)

- Step 2 : Create a Dockerfile. Head to 'Dockerfile' to copy the code.

- Step 3 : Build the image.





## Commands to build images

To run this project, you will need to run the following commands 

- `docker build -t <username>/any_name_you_want_to_define:latest . `

- `docker container run -d -p 3000:3000 <username>/any_name_you_want_to_define:latest `

- here the port is exposed of 3000:and map at our real machine at 3000

- `docker container ls `

- To stop it you can run `docker container stop: name_of_container `

- Now all the container are free. Therefore you can push this particular image on to the docker hub so anybody can use it.

- `docker push <username>/any_name_you_want_to_define:latest . `
